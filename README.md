# Raid-Toolbox

A big toolkit of spamming tools for discord.

Only compatible with Windows at the moment.

You need the modules stated in requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`

And you need python 3.6 (I use 3.6.7)

You can change the menu colour by changing the value in `config.py`

To enable proxies, add a text file called `proxies.txt` in the folder where `tokens.txt` is located, and set the value in `config.py` to 'True'

To use the Voice Spammer, unzip the FFmpeg files from the .zip files.

I will be adding more stuff to this in the future
