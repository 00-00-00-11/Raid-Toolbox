You need the modules stated in requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt` or just let Raid Toolbox install them for you.

And you need Python 3.6 (I use 3.6.7) https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/

You can change the menu colour by changing the value in `config.py`

To enable proxies, add a text file called `proxies.txt` in the folder where `tokens.txt` is located, and set the value in `config.py` to 'True'

To use the Voice Spammer, unzip the FFmpeg files from the .zip files, or download FFmpeg from here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html add add it to path

If on linux, run the command `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`.

I will be adding more stuff to this in the future
